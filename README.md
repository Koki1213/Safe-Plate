SafePlate Solutions - Smart Solutions for Smart Restaurants
Introduction

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) frequently inspect every restaurant in the United States, although the institution's name might vary by state. During these inspections, a wide array of factors determines a score the establishment has to present publicly. Some violations found during these inspections can even lead to the establishment closing down temporarily or, in extreme cases, indefinitely. Small and new food establishments need help getting them to a standard to pass such inspections. SafePlate is here to help those businesses pass inspections more consistently and with high scores!

Problem Statement

In Boston alone, more than 70% of establishments still need to pass routine inspections on the first try, as per our analysis below. This results in resources allocated primarily towards passing assessments compared to daily business and poses health risks to consumers.

Solution Overview

By analyzing Food Establishment Inspection Data from 2010 to 2021 from the greater Boston area, we identified the most critical factors that influence inspections of all establishments. Additionally, by using machine learning algorithms, we can predict those factors that will lead to passed or not-passed reviews in the future. All these insights are made accessible to establishments by providing them with an online platform that lets them identify the factors and problems they need to solve to pass inspections and plan to complete this process as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Moreover, using our analysis and machine learning algorithms, we can provide more significant enterprise-level customers with one-on-one consultancy to make their operations more efficient and safe for consumers.
